1.  A header file that declares a set of integer types having specified widths.
2.  In order to allocate a certain amount of memory for an int, instead of simply having 4 bytes of memory for an int.
3.  A BYTE is 8 bits, a WORD is 32 bits, a LONG is 32 bits, and a WORD is 16 bits
4.  The first two bytes in a BMP files are the letters B and M.
5.  bfSize is the size of the whole bmp file, which includes the headerfiles. biSize is the size of the
    BITMAPINFOHEADER header file. biSize is constant and it equals 40 bytes
6.  The bitmap is a top-down DIB with the origin at the upper left corner.
7.  biBitCount
8.  The file might not exist or be unable to be written to.
9.  We are reading the files one struct at a time.
10. 3
11. Sets your position in the file forward by the offset you specify either from the beginning of the file,
    your current position, or the end of the file, whichever you choose.
