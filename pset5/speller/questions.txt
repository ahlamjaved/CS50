3.  The reason we pass before and after by reference (instead of by value) to calculate, even though weâ€™re not changing their
    contents is because C requires passing structs by reference within functions. we dont pass by value, because
    the size would be much too large.

4.  Speller.c reads words from the file, character by character, using a for loop to begin reading the first character of
    the file, incrementing by one character until it reaches the end of the file. If the character is a letter or apostrophe,
    it is added to a word. If the word becomes larger than what we defined as the largest word possible (which we already know
    its pneumonoultramicroscopicsilicovolcanoconiosis), the word is ignored. If the word has a digit, it is also ignored. If a
    word still exists, it is counted, checked for spelling, and printed. The amount of time it takes to complete the
    checking is logged in ti_check.

5.  fgetc reads the file character by character, discriminating vs anything that isn't alphabetical or an apostrophe proceeded by
    a character. fscanf reads until white space and stores the array in a buffer, the array may contain commas etc which would
    cause problems for the misspelling function.

6.  The const type ensures that the initial value of the parameter cannot be modified. This means that each word we are checking
    along with the dictionary cannot be changed. This safety measure is useful as these values should be consistent.
